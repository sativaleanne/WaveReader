## Features

- **Real-Time Measurement**  
  Calculates wave height, period, and direction using the phone’s accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.
- **Interactive Graphs**  
  View wave data in real-time with a scrollable and zoomable custom graph that supports toggling lines for height, period, direction, and forecast prediction.
- **Location-Based Wave Data**  
  Search for wave forecasts by zip code or map, powered by the Marine Weather API and Androids Geocoding.
- **History & Export**  
  Save your measurements, filter, and export past data as CSV or JSON.
- **Forecasts**  
  Uses spectral and statistical analysis to predict the next big wave.
- **User Accounts**  
  Create an account to access all full features like data history and export tools.
