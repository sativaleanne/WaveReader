WaveReader is a mobile application for Android that will measure ocean waves. Using the built-in sensors like accelerometer and gyroscope in the phone, the app will calculate the height, direction and period of ocean waves to get a quick, real-time measurement for users out on the water. The application will also provide an option to enter a zipcode to send to a Marine Weather API to retrieve wave information for a given location. This application is a fun way for sailors and other mariners to measure waves in real time. They can also check the waves of a specific location.
